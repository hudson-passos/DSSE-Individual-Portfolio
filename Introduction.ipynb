    "I have experience with ArcGIS Pro and QGIS, with some basic knowledge of Python and R. A few years ago, I took a long course on machine learning and deep learning, but I haven't had much practice since then. I chose this course because I think it related to my field of interest which lays in a combination of geospatial analysis with data science. However, I still have several knowledge gaps and I havenâ€™t seen yet so many applications in this area. I believe in this course I can resolve both issues pursuing the following goals:"
